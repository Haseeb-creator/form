        <p>Shanti Vardhak Education Society, Bhalki was established in the year 1963 under the auspices of his Holiness Dr. Ma. Gha. Cha. Channa Basava Pattadevaru and under the chairmanship of Poojya Dr. Bheemanna Khandre. </p>
         <p>Poojya Swamiji and Sri Bhimanna Khandreji started the Society to impart quality education to the needy and the downtrodden in this backward area. The society which started with Primary and High School at Kamal Nagar in the year 1963, today runs nearly 24 educational institutions from primary level to PG level where nearly 10000 students are pursuing studies in different institutions run by the Society.</p>

         <p> Khandre Institute of Technology, Bhalki- the flagship institution of this Society, established in the year 1982 with 3 engineering courses in the beginning, now runs 05 BE and 05 PG courses.</p>

         <p>The college has got all infrastructural facilities and has attracted students from different parts of various States and also attracted a few foreign students. This college is known in the other States as Regional Engineering College (having the true characteristics of any REC).</p>
