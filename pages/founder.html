Swamiji was honoured by late Shri Giani Zial Singh, former President of India conferring on him with National Integrity Award. Recognizing his yeomen services, Gulbarga University, Gulbarga conferred on him the Honourary degree of 'Doctor of Literature'.</p>
        
       <p> He was popularly known as "Nadedaduva Devaru" meaning "god who walks" in this region. One is struck at first sight itself by Swamiji's graceful humility and blissfull simplicity of life. On the whole, he was an institution by himself for the cause of humanity.</p>
